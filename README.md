# Insurance Code Challenge

This is a project that I developed for the Azki code challenge. It is a React.js application that leverages TypeScript, Redux Toolkit and SASS as its core technologies.


## Features

- Load a list of companies, vehicles and discounts on the different pages
- Perform step by step selection of items and display a summary of the selected items at the end
- Include a skeleton card loading animation until the data is fully loaded
- Design and implement responsive design using SASS and MUI
- Implement an error page and a not found message with a link to return to the main page

## Main Technologies

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit
- SASS
